**🚀 Project: Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard 📊**
I'm proud to share the successful completion of my end-to-end data analytics project titled “Customer Churn & Subscription Analysis Dashboard”, developed using Python and Power BI under expert instruction and guidance. This project brought together data extraction, transformation, modeling, visualization, and storytelling — reflecting my growth as a hands-on Data Analyst.

**🧩 Tools & Technologies Used:**
  -Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Power Query, Dashboard Design)

  -Python (Pandas, NumPy) for early-stage data manipulation

  -SQL Concepts (for logic planning and filtering strategies)

**🔄 What I Did (Process Overview):**

**📥 Data Loading & Extraction**
  -Imported raw customer churn data from CSV into Power BI

  -Identified key fields like Customer ID, Subscription Type, Contract Length, Churn, Tenure, and Gender

**🔧 Data Cleansing & Transformation**
  -Removed nulls, fixed inconsistent entries, and cleaned whitespaces

  -Converted data types to match reporting needs (e.g., text → numeric)

  -Created a new column Churn Status to replace binary values with labels ("Active", "Churned")

**🧠 Data Modeling**
  -Defined relationships and hierarchies within the dataset

  -Created calculated columns and DAX measures such as:

    -Churn Rate (%)

    -Total Customers

    -Average Tenure

**📊 Interactive Dashboard Highlights:**
*KPI Cards:* Total Customers, Churned Customers, Churn Rate %, Avg. Tenure

*Bar Chart:* Churn by Subscription Type

*Stacked Column Chart:* Churn by Contract Length & Gender

*Donut Chart:* Distribution by Subscription Type

*Side-by-Side Chart:* Comparison of Active vs. Churned Customers

*Detailed Table:* Filterable view with fields like Customer ID, Gender, Plan, Churn Status, and Spend

🔍 Integrated slicers for Gender, Subscription Type, Contract Length, and Churn Status — enabling dynamic filtering of the entire report.

**💡 Key Takeaways:**
  -Gained real-world experience in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data modeling

  -Built an interactive BI solution aligned with business KPIs

  -Strengthened my understanding of churn behavior and customer segmentation

  -Improved skills in storytelling through data and decision-focused design

🤝 Special Thanks:
A big thank you to my mentors for the structured guidance, and to Infotact Solutions for the opportunity to apply these skills in a professional internship setting. This hands-on experience has been a turning point in my data analytics journey! #Infotact Solutions
